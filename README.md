#### Project Brief
> Your web design company is bidding for a contract to produce a website to support the delivery of online teaching to students. Several subjects will be
supported by the website (for example, Java Programming, Database Development and Web Development). Each subject will have a set of web pages
that contain the teaching materials for that subject. Students will be able to log on and then access the pages associated with the subjects that they are enrolled
upon. An administrator will be able to log on to the website and add or remove students accounts as well as enrolling students on modules.

Refer to PART1 Design file to find all the details.<br>
Refer to PART2 Implementation folder for the actual prototype of the website.<br>
